# AI for Regulatory Compliance – Systematic Literature Review Artifacts

This repository contains the research artifacts supporting the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) presented in the paper:

**Artificial Intelligence for Regulatory Compliance: A Systematic Literature Review on NLP, Machine Learning, and Ethical Governance**

The files provided document each step of the review process, from the definition of search strategies to the final selection of primary studies, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

---

## 📌 Repository Scope

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Document the methodological steps adopted in the SLR;
- Provide structured evidence of the study selection and quality assessment processes;
- Support replication, validation, or extension of the review by other researchers.

All files are intended exclusively for academic and research use.

## 📑 Description of the Steps

- **STEP 1 – Search Strategy and Raw Results**  
  Contains the search strings, databases queried (ACM, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect), execution dates, and the total number of records retrieved from each source.

- **STEP 2 – Title and Abstract Screening**  
  Documents the initial screening phase, including inclusion and exclusion decisions based on titles and abstracts, following predefined criteria.

- **STEP 3 – Full-Text Eligibility Assessment**  
  Includes the full-text review process, verifying thematic relevance, methodological adequacy, and alignment with the research questions.

- **STEP 4 – Quality Assessment (QC1–QC5)**  
  Presents the quality evaluation of eligible studies according to the five quality criteria adopted in the SLR, supporting the final selection of primary studies.

- **STEP 5 – Final Corpus and Data Extraction**  
  Contains the final set of selected studies and the structured data extracted for synthesis and analysis in the Results section of the paper.

## 🔍 Methodological Foundations

The SLR was conducted in accordance with established guidelines for systematic reviews in Information Systems and Software Engineering, particularly:

- Kitchenham, B. (2004)  
- Okoli, C. (2015)

Large Language Models (LLMs) were used as auxiliary tools during the initial screening and quality assessment phases, followed by human verification to reduce bias and ensure methodological consistency, as described in the article.

## 🔁 Reproducibility and Use

The artifacts in this repository allow other researchers to:
- Reproduce the study selection pipeline step by step;
- Verify inclusion, exclusion, and quality assessment decisions;
- Reanalyze the data using alternative criteria or analytical approaches.

No personal, sensitive, or proprietary data are included.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- The repository reflects the state of the literature at the time of data collection.
- Only peer-reviewed studies published in English from 2019 onwards were considered.
- Some degree of subjective judgment was unavoidable during quality assessment, despite mitigation strategies.

These limitations are discussed in the associated publication.
